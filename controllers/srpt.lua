	The SRPT policy

	The implementations of the Cohort and MG1 scheduling policies share much of their
	code base: one thread per core, conditional locking on single-threaded stages, exponential
	idling, etc. The main difference between the two is the way the next stage to visit is chosen
	by each thread/core: a wavefront in Cohort scheduling, polling tables in MG1. Isolating
	this difference in the implementation made it relatively straightforward to experiment
	with other visit patterns. One of these was the SRPT scheduling policy, a variation on
	Cohort's wavefront heuristic for staged servers with pipelines. Instead of visiting stages
	in a wavefront, SRPT always prefers stages at the end of the pipeline. These stages are
	visited first, and a core works its way back to the head of the pipeline. As soon as any
	stage is successfully visited (i.e. at least one event was processed), the scheduler restarts
	at the end of the pipeline. For compact stage graphs this very roughly approximates
	the Shortest Remaining Processing Time queue discipline, which is known to minimize
	response times and maximize throughput for most workloads.
